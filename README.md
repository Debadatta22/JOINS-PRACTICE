Task Description

As part of my 4-week internship at Codtech IT Solutions under the mentorship of Neela Santhosh, I was assigned a hands-on project in the domain of SQL. The main objective was to understand and implement various types of SQL JOIN operations to combine and analyze relational data. My task was to create two tables: STUDENT, containing student details, and ACADEMICS, containing their academic records. I inserted data into both tables using INSERT statements and applied SQL JOINs to fetch meaningful results.

Concepts Used

1. SQL (Structured Query Language)
SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data from relational databases. It includes commands for creating tables, inserting data, and performing queries.

2. Table Creation
Tables in SQL define a structure to store data in rows and columns. Each column has a data type, and primary keys uniquely identify each row.

4. Data Insertion
Using the INSERT INTO command, we populate tables with sample student data and subjects.

Joins Used
1. INNER JOIN
Returns records that have matching values in both tables.

3. LEFT JOIN
Returns all records from the left table (STUDENT), and matched records from the right table (ACADEMICS). Unmatched records show NULLs.

5. RIGHT JOIN
Returns all records from the right table (ACADEMICS), and matched records from the left table (STUDENT).

7. FULL OUTER JOIN
Returns all records from both tables, with NULLs where there is no match.

Outcome
This project enhanced my practical SQL skills by teaching me how to design relational tables, insert data, and apply various JOIN operations. I gained a deeper understanding of data relationships and how to extract meaningful results from multiple tables.
